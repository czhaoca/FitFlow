# FitFlow HIPAA Compliance Documentation

## Overview
FitFlow handles Protected Health Information (PHI) and must comply with HIPAA regulations. This document outlines our compliance strategy and implementation details.

## HIPAA Requirements Coverage

### 1. Administrative Safeguards

#### Security Officer Designation
- **Requirement**: Designate a HIPAA Security Officer
- **Implementation**: 
  - Security Officer role in system with elevated privileges
  - Quarterly security reviews
  - Incident response coordination

#### Workforce Training
- **Requirement**: Train all users on HIPAA requirements
- **Implementation**:
  - Mandatory HIPAA training module during onboarding
  - Annual refresher training
  - Training completion tracking in database
  - Automatic account suspension for non-compliance

#### Access Management
- **Requirement**: Implement procedures for authorization and/or supervision
- **Implementation**:
  ```sql
  -- Hierarchical permission system
  -- Trainer admins can grant/revoke team access
  -- All access changes logged in audit_log
  -- Automatic access reviews every 90 days
  ```

#### Workforce Clearance
- **Requirement**: Verify workforce members are authorized for PHI access
- **Implementation**:
  - Background check integration for trainers
  - License verification system
  - Two-factor authentication mandatory

### 2. Physical Safeguards

#### Facility Access Controls
- **Requirement**: Limit physical access to systems
- **Implementation**:
  - Cloud infrastructure (AWS/Azure) with SOC 2 compliance
  - No on-premise servers with PHI
  - Encrypted laptops/devices policy

#### Workstation Security
- **Requirement**: Secure workstations accessing PHI
- **Implementation**:
  - Automatic session timeout (15 minutes)
  - Screen lock requirements
  - Clear desk policy enforcement
  - Remote wipe capability for mobile devices

### 3. Technical Safeguards

#### Access Control
- **Requirement**: Unique user identification, automatic logoff, encryption
- **Implementation**:

```javascript
// Unique User Identification
- UUID-based user IDs
- No shared accounts allowed
- Strong password requirements:
  - Minimum 12 characters
  - Upper/lowercase, numbers, symbols
  - Password history (last 12)
  - 90-day expiration

// Automatic Logoff
- 15-minute idle timeout
- Session invalidation on suspicious activity
- Forced re-authentication for sensitive operations

// Encryption and Decryption
- AES-256 encryption for PHI at rest
- TLS 1.3 for data in transit
- Field-level encryption for sensitive data
```

#### Audit Controls
- **Requirement**: Hardware, software, and procedural mechanisms for recording access
- **Implementation**:

```sql
-- Comprehensive audit logging
CREATE TABLE audit_log (
    id UUID PRIMARY KEY,
    user_id UUID NOT NULL,
    action VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL,
    resource_type VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL,
    resource_id UUID NOT NULL,
    phi_accessed BOOLEAN DEFAULT FALSE,
    ip_address INET,
    user_agent TEXT,
    success BOOLEAN,
    error_details TEXT,
    created_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT NOW()
);

-- Automated monitoring for:
-- - Excessive access patterns
-- - After-hours access
-- - Failed authentication attempts
-- - Bulk data exports
```

#### Integrity Controls
- **Requirement**: Ensure PHI is not improperly altered or destroyed
- **Implementation**:
  - Database backups with point-in-time recovery
  - Soft deletes only (no hard deletes of PHI)
  - Change tracking for all PHI modifications
  - Data validation at application and database levels

#### Transmission Security
- **Requirement**: Protect PHI during transmission
- **Implementation**:
  - TLS 1.3 minimum for all connections
  - Certificate pinning for mobile apps
  - VPN requirements for administrative access
  - Email encryption for PHI (using S/MIME or PGP)

### 4. Organizational Requirements

1. **Privacy Policy**
   - Client-facing privacy notice
   - Use and disclosure practices
   - Client rights under HIPAA

2. **Security Policy**
   - Technical safeguards
   - Administrative procedures
   - Physical security measures

3. **Incident Response Plan**
   - Breach detection procedures
   - Notification timelines (within 60 days)
   - Remediation steps
   - Documentation requirements

4. **Data Retention Policy**
   - 7-year retention for client records
   - Secure disposal procedures
   - Legal hold capabilities

5. **Risk Assessment Policy**
   - Annual risk assessments
   - Vulnerability scanning
   - Penetration testing
   - Risk mitigation tracking

## Technical Implementation Details

### Encryption Strategy
```javascript
// Field-level encryption for PHI
const encryptedFields = [
  'clients.first_name',
  'clients.last_name',
  'clients.email',
  'clients.phone',
  'clients.date_of_birth',
  'clients.emergency_contact',
  'clients.medical_info',
  'session_notes.subjective',
  'session_notes.objective',
  'session_notes.assessment',
  'session_notes.plan',
  'session_notes.private_notes'
];

// Encryption at application layer
class PHIEncryption {
  encrypt(data) {
    // AES-256-GCM encryption
    // Key rotation every 90 days
    // Separate keys per tenant
  }
  
  decrypt(encryptedData) {
    // Automatic audit log entry
    // Access control verification
    // Return decrypted data
  }
}
```

### Access Logging
```javascript
// Middleware for PHI access logging
app.use('/api/*', async (req, res, next) => {
  const startTime = Date.now();
  
  // Log the access attempt
  const accessLog = await createAccessLog({
    userId: req.user.id,
    endpoint: req.path,
    method: req.method,
    ipAddress: req.ip,
    userAgent: req.headers['user-agent']
  });
  
  // Track response
  res.on('finish', async () => {
    await updateAccessLog(accessLog.id, {
      statusCode: res.statusCode,
      duration: Date.now() - startTime,
      phiAccessed: determineIfPHIAccessed(req, res)
    });
  });
  
  next();
});
```

### Breach Detection
```javascript
// Automated breach detection rules
const breachDetectionRules = [
  {
    name: 'Excessive Downloads',
    condition: 'COUNT(downloads) > 100 in 1 hour',
    action: 'Alert security officer, suspend account'
  },
  {
    name: 'Unusual Access Pattern',
    condition: 'Access from new location/device',
    action: 'Require re-authentication'
  },
  {
    name: 'After Hours Access',
    condition: 'Access outside business hours',
    action: 'Log and monitor closely'
  },
  {
    name: 'Failed Authentication',
    condition: '5 failed attempts in 10 minutes',
    action: 'Lock account, alert user'
  }
];
```
